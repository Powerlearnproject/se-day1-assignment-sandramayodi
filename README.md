#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is the application of systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of softwares.
 It provides a way to manage the resources,schedule, and budget of the project.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The birth of software engineering-It was first used in 1968 at the NATO software engineering confrence which marked the recognition of software development as a distinct discipline requiring systematic approaches.
2. Development of structures programming-It emphasized the use of clear,structurd code to improve software quality and maintainability
3. The agile manifesto-This marked a shi towards more flexible and collaborative approaches to software development ,focusing on iterative development,customer collaboration and responding to change over rigid processes
   
    List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   
1. Requirements Analysis and specification  -Purpose is to identify and document  the requirements of the proposed system.
2. Design-Focuses on how it will be done by creating the architecture of the system.
3. Implementation-The actual code(program) is written according to the architecture.
4. Testing-Executing the system to find out erros and noncompliances.
 5. Deployment-Delivering the system to the customer and unsure that it is operational.
6. Maintenance-Post delivery activity that is concerned with modifying the system to correct faults, improve performance and adapt to the changed/changing environment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development.
It divides the SDLC into distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) that must be completed in order.
Each phase must be fully completed before moving on to the next phase, with little to no overlap between phases while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development where
development is broken down into small cycles called sprints, allowing for regular feedback and continuous improvement
Waterfall model is used in  Projects with Clear, Fixed Requirements: Waterfall is well-suited for projects where the requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change. For example, developing a payroll system for a company with fixed rules and requirements while agile deal with Projects with Evolving Requirements: Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change or are not fully understood at the outset, such as developing a new mobile app with rapidly changing market demands.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- focus on writing and maintaining code, implementing new features, and ensuring the software meets technical requirements.
Quality Assuarance Engineer-Conducts testing to ensure the software meets requirements and is free of defects
Project manager-Oversees the entire project, ensures milestones are met, and manages communication with stakeholder


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's-
Code Writing Efficiency: IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, and debugging code. They often include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and auto-indentation, which make coding faster and reduce the likelihood of syntax errors.

Debugging Tools: IDEs offer powerful debugging tools that help developers identify and fix errors in their code. Breakpoints, step-through debugging, and variable inspection are common features that make debugging more straightforward and efficient.

Project Management: IDEs support project management by organizing files, libraries, and resources in a structured way. This helps developers navigate and manage their projects more effectively.

Integration with Other Tools: IDEs often integrate with version control systems (like Git), build automation tools (like Maven or Gradle), testing frameworks, and other development tools, providing a centralized environment for all development activities.

Support for Multiple Languages and Frameworks: Many IDEs support multiple programming languages and frameworks, making them versatile tools for developers who work on diverse projects.
An exmaple is Visual Code Studio
VCS-
Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It provides mechanisms to merge changes and resolve conflicts, making collaborative development more manageable and organized.

Tracking Changes: VCS keeps a detailed history of all changes made to the codebase. This allows developers to track who made changes, what changes were made, and when. This historical record is invaluable for understanding the evolution of a project, debugging, and auditing.

Backup and Restore: VCS acts as a backup system for the codebase. In case of accidental deletion or corruption of code, developers can revert to previous versions of the code.

Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Once the changes are tested and validated, they can be merged back into the main branch. This supports parallel development and improves code quality by isolating new development work.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): VCS is often integrated with CI/CD pipelines to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. This ensures that new changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual intervention and speeding up the development process.
An example is GIT


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge:
1.Requirements in software projects can frequently change due to evolving business needs:
Strategy:
Use Agile practices such as Scrum or Kanban, which emphasize iterative development, frequent feedback, and the ability to accommodate changes
challenge:
Security vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and damage to a company's reputation.
Strategy:
Implement Security Best Practices: Follow security best practices such as input validation, secure coding standards, and regular patching and updates.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation to ensure that each part functions correctly. A "unit" can be the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in the system, typically a function or method.
Importance:
Early Defect Detection: Unit tests help detect bugs early in the development process, often before the software is integrated with other components
2.Integration testing focuses on testing the interactions and data flow between integrated units or components. It ensures that combined units work together correctly and that the interfaces between them are properly defined and functioning.
Importance:
Detection of Interface Issues: Integration testing helps identify issues that may arise when individual components are combined, such as mismatched interfaces, data type mismatches, or incorrect API usage
3.System testing involves testing the complete integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements. This type of testing is conducted in an environment that closely mirrors the production environment.
Importance:
Validation Against Requirements: System testing ensures that the entire application meets the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the requirements document.
4.Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether a software system meets the acceptance criteria and whether it is ready for deployment. This type of testing is typically conducted by the end-users, stakeholders, or the QA team.
Importance:
Validation of User Requirements: Acceptance testing ensures that the software meets the end-user requirements and expectations. It verifies that the software delivers the expected value and solves the intended problems.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
IMPORTANCE:
Enhanced Accuracy and Relevanced.
Control Over Output
Improved Efficiency

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

VAGUE PROMPT:Tell me about dogs
IMPROVEMENT:what are dogs and what do they do .eat,drink and how they relate with human.
